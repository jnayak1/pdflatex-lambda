KOMA Script 
a versatile LaTeX2e bundle
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS 
-----------------------

There are various ways that KOMA Script can be distributed.  The primary
distribution from the KOMA Script maintainers consists of a complete TEXMF
tree (also known as the/a TDS tree).  This TEXMF tree in its original form is
provided as a ZIP archive.  It may also be distributed in other archival
formats.  When the following text refers to an archive, it therefore does not
necessarily refer to a ZIP archive.  When creating a new archive, distributors
are strongly encouraged to preserve the structure and contents of the TEXMF
tree so that these instructions remain valid.  Distributors are otherwise
urged to provide their own instructions for installation.

Distribution of the expanded TEXMF tree is also permitted.  Should, as a
result, the structure or the contents of the TEXMF tree be modified (within
the framework of that which is permitted by the license) such that these
installation instructions partially or entirely no longer apply, the
distributor should provide new directions.

The user should therefore first check to see whether the distributor has
included further installation directions.  Logically the name of these
directions would also begin with `INSTALLD.', immediately followed by the
distributor's name or acronym.  A `README' file should likewise created.


Installation from an archive
----------------------------

If you received the KOMA Script archive with a complete TEXMF tree, the
installation is quite easy.  First check to see whether the archive does in
fact contain a complete TEXMF tree.  Take a look at the contents of the
archive; there should be three directories: `doc/latex/koma-script',
`tex/latex/koma-script' and `source/latex/koma-script', the last with
additional subdirectories.  In each of these directories there are several
files.  A file `README' should be found at least at
`doc/latex/koma-script/README'.  It may be found outside the archive as well.

When you unpack such an archive be sure to preserve the directory structure,
but without creating a new directory, either in the local TEXMF tree or in a
private TEXMF tree.  More information about the local TEXMF tree and the
question of a private TEXMF tree, as well as how one makes this known to the
system can be found in the directions for your TEX system.

Finally, update or `refresh' the filename database.  With teTeX and
teTeX-based systems this is done with the program `texconfig' or directly with
`texhash' or `mktexlsr'.  With MiKTeX you will find the corresponding button
in the application `MiKTeX Options'.  Depending on the permissions set for
your installation directory, you may have to do this as administrator or 
root.  For more information about this see the manual of your TeX system!


Installation of an expanded TEXMF tree
--------------------------------------

If KOMA Script is already present as an expanded TEXMF tree, you can either
register it in the system as a further TEXMF tree or you can copy the contents
of this TEXMF tree -- while preserving the directory structure -- into a
private or local TEXMF tree.

Here too a refresh of the filename database is necessary.  See the last
paragraph of the previous section for more information.


Installation from a minimal distribution
----------------------------------------

Installation from a minimal distribution, which only includes those files
listed as minimally necessary in the `manifest.txt', is not as simple.  For
this Gnu-make and other UNIX tools are essential!

With this in mind, the process is as follows:

- Create a Makefile.cfg file.

- Copy one of the lines that begins with `#INSTALLTEXMF' from the file
  `Makefile.baseinit' into this new file. 

- Remove the hash symbol (#) from the beginning.

- Edit this line so that the name of the directory where the TEXMF tree is to
  be installed appears following the equal sign.
  CAUTION: No forward slash (/) or backslash (\) at the end of the directory
  name!

- Run your `make' program.

- After `make' has successfully been run with no errors, run `make install'.

Finally, update or `refresh' the filename database.  With teTeX and
teTeX-based systems this is done with the program `texconfig' or directly with
`texhash' or `mktexlsr'.  With MiKTeX you will find the corresponding button
in the application `MiKTeX Options'.  Depending on the permissions set for
your installation directory, you may have to do this as administrator or 
root.  For more information about this see the manual of your TeX system!


`Last resort' installation from a minimal distribution
------------------------------------------------------

Even if you do not have the necessary Gnu-make or other UNIX tools needed to
install using `make', it is still possible to properly install the KOMA Script
package from the minimal distribution.  It just means doing more of the work
yourself.

- First create the following new directories in the TEXMF tree in which you
  wish to install KOMA Script: `source/latex/koma-script',
  `doc/latex/koma-script' and `tex/latex/koma-script'.

- Copy all of the files from the KOMA Script distribution into the new
  directory `source/latex/koma-script'.

- Copy all files with filenames ending in `.pdf', `.html', or `.txt' and the
  `README' file into the directory `doc/latex/koma-script'.

- Change directory to 'source/latex/koma-script'.

- Run the command `tex scrmain.ins'. Answer any possible questions with `y'
  for `yes'.

- Copy all newly created files whose filenames end in `.cls', `.sty' or `.lco'
  into the directory `tex/latex/koma-script'.

Finally, update or `refresh' the filename database.  With teTeX and
teTeX-based systems this is done with the program `texconfig' or directly with
`texhash' or `mktexlsr'.  With MiKTeX you will find the corresponding button
in the application `MiKTeX Options'.  Depending on the permissions set for
your installation directory, you may have to do this as administrator or
root.  For more information about this see the manual of your TeX system!
