               The TeX Catalogue License Definitions: OTHER-FREE

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

other-free: Licenses not clearly (or uniquely) defined, but believed free.

   This license statement is used in two distinct circumstances. Either the
   software is covered by a license that does not fit into any of the
   "formally" specified categories, but the catalogue team judges it usable
   by most users. Otherwise, the software consists of distinct parts to which
   different (free) licenses apply.

   While use is probably safe, each potential user should check the
   software's license statement (or statements) before using the software.

   Further information about the set of TeX Catalogue License Categories is
   available.
